# Daily-Planner

## Description
Daily work day tasks can be diffcult to keep track of when you have many different tasks at different times. It can help to have a place to write down tasksto prevent you from forgetting. In order to create a place which allows users to plan out their day by the hour, I created this website that allows users to enter their specific tasks into a military time style planner that differentiates them by hour. In the process of creating this website I became better acquainted with methods of storing local information so that reloading or closing the page won't cause the user to lose their information. This solves the issue of users being unable to see their tasks laid out by the hour, and if the website won't forget, then that will ensure that the user will not forget their tasks.

## Installation

This project requires no installation for usage rather than opening the website, following the link in a browser of your choice, and then using the buttons to activate the functions of the website. The project was built using git bash and microsoft visual code.

## Usage
When the website is first opened, the user will see the time and date, and then below that they can see the time blocks that contain the areas to write in what has been planned for the day. When something has been written in a timeblock, the user can hit the save button to save their entry into said text box. The save button only works for the text block that it is next to, so be sure to not enter anything into one block and hit save in another box.

## Features
This website features the utilization of the users local storage in order to save information that has been entered into the webpage even if it has been closed or reloaded. The website features a text editor that can be edited whenever, but only when the save button is pressed will the text area update with what has been entered. The website also features the time and date, which is present at the top of the website. The time boxes that are from before, after, or are the current time, all have different colors to make sure it is clear what has already passed and what is in the future, or what is current.
